# Reforges App on the web yo.

Before starting, make sure you have Node.js and NPM installed.

Once they are installed, navigate to this directory in Terminal, and do an 'npm install' command in order to install
all dev dependencies.

The command "npm run watch:all" will build, run a local server (url at localhost:3000), and continually watch for changes in the 'src' folder and update accordingly. With browsersync installed as part of this package, multiple devices viewing off your local server, will updateif the state of the app changes on one of them, saving time with cross-compatibility testing. Refer to package.json if you only want run specific commands.
